# Proxy-Discord-Bot
X (formerly Twitter) link: `https://twitter.com/tuffproxies` <br />
Automated distribution of residential proxy to customers.

The Discord bot was developed to automatically distribute proxies to customers 24/7, regardless of time zone differences.

The software is coded mainly in JavaScript.<br />
The software uses APIs from Stripe and Proxy provider.<br />
The software uses MongoDB for database management.

# How it works
◼ Before using the proxy, users will be required to make purchases on Discord using the developed Discord bot.<br />
◼ After purchase, the software will register the user's account on our provider's platform and assign the purchased amount of data to the user's account.<br />
◼ The user can use the bot to specify which proxy region to generate.<br />
◼ The software is able to generate a large number of proxies for the user.<br />
◼ Each IP generated is equivalent to one unique address.

**Recent update**<br />
◼ Users can now generate random names, emails, and addresses using the Discord bot.
